          <p>John Rogers, Instructor in Physics, was not surprised by the faculty responses. </p>
          <p>&ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s an assumption that everyone on the faculty is supporting Hillary Clinton,&rdquo; said Rogers. &ldquo;If it was clear that there was a divide on the faculty, it would be more of an issue than in a typical election.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>Only 37 percent of faculty respondents approve of requiring voters to provide a photo ID when voting.</p>
          <p>In contrast, 64 percent of students favor a law requiring photo ID to vote. </p>
          <p>Kyle Welch &rsquo;18 said, &ldquo;You need an ID to drive in the country, you need an ID to get alcohol, you need an ID to do almost anything as a legal adult &ndash; except for voting. And [not having a requirement] allows people to cheat the system. It allows for a lot of votes to pop out of thin air without any identification behind them. Having an ID largely prevents that from happening.&rdquo;</p>

          <p>Seventy-seven percent of student respondents felt that undocumented immigrants should be allowed to stay in the United States and eventually apply for citizenship, while 14.0 percent believe they should be required to leave the United States. Ten percent of students surveyed believe people should be allowed to stay in the U.S. legally but not be allowed to apply for citizenship. </p>
          <p>Trevor Lazar &rsquo;17, a four-year Senior from Scottsdale, Ariz., said, &ldquo;I think with folks that are already here, they should be allowed to stay in the country and be given a quick and reasonable path to at least a visa or a Green Card, if not citizenship &ndash; mainly because they drive a lot of the economic prosperity that has taken hold in parts of the country that have large amounts of undocumented workers. They should be able to gain the protection of the government and make sure their rights as workers are protected.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>The results of the survey revealed that 80.5 percent of students would support a U.S. effort to accept refugees from Syria and other places of conflict in the Middle East.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;I think that as one of the more financially well-off countries in the world, we have a human and moral responsibility to take in refugees,&rdquo; said Sam Bird &rsquo;18. &ldquo;At the same point, making sure that, for the citizens of this nation, refugees are properly screened, and then making sure that refugees have proper accommodations when they can come to the United States, so they don&rsquo;t have to worry about housing for the time being.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>Faculty and student respondents were also asked to answer questions about their views on background checks for gun purchases, income inequality, and hydraulic fracking.</p>        </div>

          <blockquote>
            <p>&ldquo;I think that towards the beginning of the race, it sparked a wide divide among students because a lot of students were very strongly in support of Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton and then a lot of students weren’t sure. But I think as the actual election has gotten closer, it seems like the diversity of opinion has dwindled. It seems like there are a lot of people who are pro-Hillary, and most people it seems are anti-Trump. It seems that the divide of the student body before the election has closed just because there aren’t as many students who support Trump as there were before.&rdquo;</p>
